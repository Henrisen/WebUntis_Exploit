# WebUntis Exploit

## How does this work?
Some WebUntis servers do not secure their permissions so anyone can look up anyone!

## How to use it:
 - Install all packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 - Edit the script with your school id, school webuntis server, username and password

 - Run the script:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
